## Story
I would like to be able to know when I completed a story. I don't yet
need to show this information anywhere, but I will want to later.

## Acceptance criteria
- Each task will store the timestamp when it was last updated
- When clicking complete, the timestamp will be updated
- When deleting a task, the timestamp will be updated

## Technical notes
Again, you will not need to write any migrations - the tasks table should be
ready for you.
