<h1>Welcome to Aledade's code test!</h1>
<p class="lead">
  The purpose of this exercise is to test your ability to quickly and iteratively build features in a new code base.
</p>

<p>
  Despite its contrived simplicity, this application uses the same frameworks we utilize in our production environment.
</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Within the time allotted, your task is to:
<ol>
  <li>Execute as many feature stories as possible</li>
  <li>Commit your work as you accomplish tasks</li>
  <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/blog/2010/03/10/bundles.html">Bundle your code</a>
    (<code>git bundle create /tmp/todo_work.bundle master</code>),
    then send it to <a href="mailto:techrecruiting@aledade.com">Aledade Tech Recruiting</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>The application</h3>
<p>You will be building a simple "TODO" application.
It already includes a number of tasks, which are themselves the stories you must work on.
<p>
<p>
You can view stories within the application itself, or as Markdown files in <code>starting_tasks/</code>.
</p>
